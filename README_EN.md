# SPT-Korean-Project-Alpha_Test
Hello! Welcome to SPT-Korean-Project-Alpha_Test.

My name is Golani, and I led this project.
I am deeply grateful to Makina for working on the project with me.
Also, thanks to Gomeng for actively providing this mod to me.

There are still a lot of mistranslations, so I would appreciate it if you could test them and report them.
Thank you for reading and I hope to see you in the official version soon.

## How to apply it
